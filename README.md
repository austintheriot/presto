# Presto Web App for Musicians

## ðŸŽ¼ About the Project
Presto is a React single-page web app designed and developed by musicians for musicians. In today's day and age, meeting and hiring local musicians should be easy, and, in the past, it's been anything but. Presto is designed to reduce the barriers to collaboration by enabling guests and musicians to make public posts based on location. Need a singer? Make a post. Looking for a fill-in trumpet player for a gig this weekend? Write a post. Write a little on your own profile so that others can see what musical services you offer. Then, when you've found a musician that you'd like to work with, message them privately to connect. 

This app is intended for performers, composers, arrangers, conductors, soloists, ensembles, bands, and any guests interested in hiring them. 

## Behind the Scenes
### React
Presto was initialized with Create React App, and is built to be a fast, secure, single page application.
### Back End 
Firebase authentication, file storage, and database system for the backend. 
### APIs
Geoapify API to validate users' location.
### Styling
CSS modules
Custom styling inspired by Google's Material UI - clean, accessible, modern.
