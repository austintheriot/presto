# Presto Web App for Musicians

## ðŸŽµ About the Project

Presto is a React single-page web app designed and developed by musicians for
musicians. In today's day and age, meeting (and hiring) local musicians should
be easy, but until now, there hasn't been a social media space for musicians to
connect with other musicians from their communities. Especially today, in the
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, local communities have become more fragmented
than ever before.

Presto is designed to provide a space for local musical communities to reconnect
by enabling guests and musicians to make public posts based on location. Trying
to meet a singer? Make a post. Need a fill-in trumpet player for a gig this
weekend? Write a post. Tell a little about youself own profile so that others
can see what musical services you offer. Then, when you've found a musician that
you'd like to work with, message them privately to connect.

This app is intended for performers, composers, arrangers, conductors, soloists,
ensembles, bands, and any guests interested in hiring them.

## Behind the Scenes

### React & TypeScript:

Presto is a single-page web app bootstrapped with Create React App and written
in TypeScript, It is built to be fast, secure, and intuitive.

### State Management:

- Hooks
- Redux

### Back End

- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud Firestore

### 3rd Party API's:

Presto also uses the Geoapify API to validate users' location: they can either
autofill their location using the built-in JavaScript Geolocation API combined
with Geoapify, or they can manually input their location and select from the
options provided by the Geoapify autocomplete API.

### Styling

- Designed in Adobe XD
- Styled with SCSS modules
- Inspired by Google's Material UI to be clean, accessible, and modern.
